<h2 class="heading_lineheight1">Some Fun Facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In season 3, episode 17, "The Ember Island Players," Toph is elated to learn that her character is played by a tough, burly male actor.</li>
  <li>The cabbage merchant who iconically yells, "My cabbages!" (as his cabbages are repeatedly destroyed or lost) only appears in four episodes, though he is also referenced in The Ember Island Players (S3 E17).</li>
  <li>The waterbending, earthbending, firebending and airbending are inspired by martial arts: Tai Chi Chuan, Hung Gar Kuen, Northern Shaolin, and Baguazhang, respectively.</li>
</ul>

    <h5><b>Bio</b></h5>
    <br>
    <p>I'm Emily Condon, an early career journalist, with a focus on reporting for various digital platforms. I primarily tell political stories through website articles and digital video, but also have experience with broadcast video and stagnant social platform posts. Within politics, I have covered political conventions and the judiciary. But besides that, I also have experience with enterprise business reporting, breaking national news, Olympics coverage, local news in major cities and human interest stories. I'm committed to bringing innovative storytelling techniques to the newsroom, using data-driven analysis in stories, social news gathering techniques and going beyond my articles to create unique native social content. I'm primarily interested in newsrooms in Washington D.C. and New York but also have an interest in reporting in the Midwest, a primarily influential demographic in American political culture.</p>
